\title{Calculate dispersion for a replicated experiment.}
\usage{
add_dispersion(data, factors, response = "response", df = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame (or similar)}

\item{factors}{Character vector of factor names}

\item{response}{Name of the response column}

\item{df}{If \code{TRUE}, the output is coerced with \code{as.data.frame}. Otherwise a \code{tibble} is returned.}
}
\description{
Collects replicate runs and calculates the location (mean)
and dispersion (\eqn{\ln s^2}{ln(s^2)}), where \eqn{s^2}{s^2}
is the sample variance and \eqn{\ln}{ln} is the natural logarithm.
}
\details{
Returns a data frame with new column \code{lns2}. The column with
the response is replaced with the mean response across the replicates.
